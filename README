Server side tools to back up hosts using rsync.

- Supports pull from client, push to server and local->local
  transfers
- Automatic filesystem cleaner included to prevent
  over filling the disk.
- Polling is possible with high run interval (e.g. 30 mins)
  together with lowish snapshot expiration (e.g. 1 d)
- Developed on OpenBSD but runs on Linux as well
- Only rsync and OpenBSD base tools needed
