* Features that can be configured:
  - Expiration time for less important hosts
  - Robust filter expressions what to include/exclude

* Store lots of FULL backups with the cost
  of only changed files.

  Diskspace needed for regular UNIX workstation
  installation:

  Size of installation 4GB, we backup all of it.

  1st day, initial import: 4GB
  2nd day, only changed files: 4GB + 300MB = 4,3GB
  3nd day, only changed files: 4,3GB + 100MB = 4,4GB
  etc.

* Only base of OpenBSD needed and only one 3rd package
  which is net/rsync.
