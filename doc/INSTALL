1) Configure directory that will hold back up snapshots.
Default is /backups.

2) Configure "config/backup.conf" and "config/dump.conf".
Check the .sample and their comments for more specific
documentation. Do "ssh host" for each host you just set up,
you just need to accept the signature part and you can
abort the (password) authentication that follows it.
You don't have to install the backupper-server anywhere,
it will run fine as is.

3) You will need a master ssh key. You can use tools/genkey.sh
to generate it.

That should be it regarding the server part. Now configure
machines or dirctories you want to back up. Root privileges
are needed for a system wide snapshot.

4) Install rsync on every machine.
