1) Get a big disc and make one partition to use
whole disc. Mount it somewhere for example "/backups".

2) Configure "config/backup.conf" and "config/dump.conf".
Check the .sample and their comments for more specific
documentation.

3) You will need a master ssh key. You can use tools/genkey.sh
to generate it.
