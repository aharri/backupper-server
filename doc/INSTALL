1) Get a big disc and make one partition to use
whole disc. Mount it somewhere, for example "/backups".

2) Configure "config/backup.conf" and "config/dump.conf".
Check the .sample and their comments for more specific
documentation. Do "ssh host" for each host you just set up,
you just need to accept the signature part and you can
abort the (password) authentication that follows it.
You don't have to install the backupper-server anywhere,
it will run fine as is.

3) You will need a master ssh key. You can use tools/genkey.sh
to generate it.

That should be it regarding the server part. Now configure
machines you want to pull with your newly created pubkey.
Use root account if you want to back up the whole machine.

4) Install rsync on every machine.
